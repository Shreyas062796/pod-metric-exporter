1. An alternate approach to polling periodically is that you can maybe only get the pods when
somebody calls the metrics api. This would reduce the number of api calls that we make to the
kubernetes api which would be good. We can also use some go routines and channels with this so
that if there are multiple api calls happening at the sametime we can concurrently run them.

2. I would probably have to modify my program because right now I just have filtering by labels.
We would have to add some conditional logic if we have multiple things that we can look for other
than just the label selector. We may also need to make the command line arguments a bit more general
as well or add more flags for different kinds of filters.

3. I would test my code by writing test cases that would test the outputs that we get for different
functions that we have. We would want to test for both the positive cases and make sure that we hit
all the conditionals in the code and remove any unnecessary logic that doesn't make sense. I would
probably make things more modular and seperate some of the logic into other functions. The part that
I would prioritize would be the function that gets the pods from the kubernetes api and the one that
would be setting the prometheus gauge metric. But I would try to test all the diffrent functions and
make sure that my code coverage is high and that I have done my best at trying to test all my possible
inputs as possible.
